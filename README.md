# Paymint-API-v2

---

## A Quick Overview

- Firebase cloud functions for data retrieval and processing
- Firestore to store price quotes on user transactions
- Fully self-deployable
- Supports custom Esplora-Electrs servers
- Open source, minimal and privacy preserving wallet analytics

## Instructions for self-hosting the API
The project is fully self deployable already but documentation for this is still under way :/

NOTE: Add custom firebase project config under functions/util/config.js

## A note on analytics

Since financial privacy is important (especially when it comes to Bitcoin), it's paramount to explain what kind of data the server collects, what is stored, and what is discarded of.
